# Windows KB Switcher Thing

This program will run one of two batch scripts depending on if the last keypress was made with a logitch unifying receiver (tv.bat) or any other keyboard (normal.bat).
It will run this command once for each series of keypresses made with that keyboard.

The program runs in the system tray, and can be closed by choosing Exit from its context menu.

## Why does this exist

I have a Logitech K400 Plus wireless keyboard by my TV, which is hooked up to my desktop in another room. 
I would like my computer to automatically switch my audio device and display output to the TV when I type on my K400, 
and I'd like everything switched back when I type with the keyboard at my desk.
